# Julia
Welcome to Julia directory. In this directory I will be documenting concepts that I learn on Julia as part of my Msc program in Bioinformatics.

## Outline

**Julia_exercises** contains questions and answers for each practical assignment given in class

**Julia_md** contains documentation on various sections of the modules that can eventually serve as a tutorial.

**Julia.jl** is my first Julia program that prints  out "Hello world!"
